# Business_Insights_360
This project was completed as part of the Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this case study, I designed and implemented a Business Intelligence dashboard for **AtliQ Hardware** — a fast-growing computer hardware company. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor performance across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain functions.
End-to-End Data Analytics.

This repository contains my first complete Power BI project based on Atliq’s sales and financial data, created as part of my Data Analytics learning journey.
The project covers everything from data cleaning and modeling to advanced DAX and interactive dashboard design.
