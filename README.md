# BusinessInsights360
This project was completed as part of the Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this case study, I designed and implemented a Business Intelligence dashboard for AtliQ Hardware — a fast-growing computer hardware company. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor performance across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain functions.
